Log errors

* Not enough values for deriving formula

  To create a formula its required to have at least 3 measurements. 

* Error validating created formula. Deviation to large, formula rejected

  The device will try to create formulas with different complexities. It will try to 
  validate the formula using the supplied values. If the differnce is more than 1.6 SG on any point
  the formula will be rejected. Check the entered values if they seams to be resonable.

* No valid calibration values, please calibrate the device.

  The gyro needs to be calibrated at 90 degress (flat). This is done on the configration page.

* Low on memory, skipping push

  The arduino libraries sometimes leak memory, this only occurs when running in configuration mode. To avoid
  crashes the device will skip pushing data if the memory drops to much. Network connections seams to be connected
  to memory leaks. 

* Unable to set header, invalid value

  Check the format for your custom header. This means it has not a correct format.

* Influxdb push failed response
* Brewfather push failed response
* HTTP push failed response

  All these errors are standard http error codes. This are the commone ones;

  *  400 - Bad request. Probably an issue with the post format. Check format in the format editor.
  *  401 - Unathorized. The service needs an token or other means to authenticate the device. 
  *  403 - Forbidden. Could be an issue with token or URL. 
  *  404 - Not found. Probably a wrong URL.
  
* MQTT push on <topic> failed error

  * -3 - Network failed connected
  * -10 - Connection denied
